        <p><b>About Hayden:</b><br><a href=https://haydehill.github.io/haydehill.github.io>https://haydehill.github.io/haydehill.github.io/</a><br>I live in Adelaide, South Australia, my student number is S3799262 and I am a part of the “I see dev people” group. I work full-time as an IT Support Officer, my day to day is spent providing IT help to my company’s workforce and contributing towards the maintenance of the IT network. My interest in IT stems from being fascinated with tech from a young age and what IT can do. The ever presence of IT in day to day life is astonishing, this is what keeps me interested. To date I have completed a certificate level qualification in IT, however now I am looking to further that by completing a degree. In my spare time you’ll find me playing with trains, on a full-sized heritage railway on the Fleurieu Peninsula.</p>

I have worked as mobile tech support for a Windows focused company and am a RedHat Certified Engineer. IT and automation interest me greatly as they allow us to achieve more than ever before.</p>

        <p><b>About Lauren:</b><br><a href=https://laurenonline.github.io/MyProfile>https://laurenonline.github.io/MyProfile/</a><br>My name is Lauren Ralley, Student number S3805366 and I’m a proud Melbournite and member of I See Dev People! I’ve always been at fingers length to a keyboard, virtual or otherwise, ever since I was a child. Although I love the outdoors, adventuring with my dogs and long pointless road trips nothing is more satisfying to me than reading an article or being told about an advancement in technology. I work in Insurance and have overseen some incredible transformation projects centred around technology. I’ve been involved in the discovery and testing of these projects which I’ve enjoyed so I hope to advance my skills in IT and enter a more IT based role in the future.</p>

        <p><b>About Nathan:</b><br><a href=https://adam0268.github.io/I2IT>https://adam0268.github.io/I2IT/</a><br>My name is Nathan Adam (S3802423), I’m 23 years old, and I live in McLaren Vale, South Australia.

Outside of work, I enjoy baking, playing video games, and collecting music on vinyl. I don’t have any formal background or qualifications in IT, but I’ve been interested in computers and technology for as long as I can remember. Through my studies at RMIT, I hope to gain a better understanding of/find employment in the IT industry.</p>

        <p><b>About Oskar:</b><br><a href=https://oskardeacon.github.io/oskardeacon-github.io>https://oskardeacon.github.io/oskardeacon-github.io/</a><br>My name is Oskar Deacon and I am 18 years old. My student number is s3799696, I live in Brisbane, Queensland and I am a member of the I see dev people group. I am a full-time student studying a financial planning degree through RMIT. My hobbies include playing squash, playing PlayStation 4 and PC games, going out with friends on the weekends, spending time with my family and watching Netflix. I ever really had an interest in IT until around 16 years of age and this is because at school, I did for one term a small robotics and coding subject. While this wasn’t enough to make me pursue a career in the IT world, it did peak my interests. I have only little IT experience, as the previously mentioned subject was the only experience I had.</p>
